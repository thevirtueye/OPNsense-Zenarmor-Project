## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a segmented hospital network using the open-source **OPNsense** firewall and the **Zenarmor** Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) plugin.

The system was entirely built in a virtual lab environment using VMware, with the aim of simulating realistic inter-network traffic and security policy enforcement. The project includes the deployment of virtual machines, firewall configuration, policy implementation, and simulated cyberattacks with traffic inspection.

## Network Topology

The simulated network consists of 7 segments, each representing a functional area within a hospital environment. VLANs are used to logically separate the zones, and all traffic is routed and filtered via OPNsense 25.1.

### VLAN Mapping

| VLAN ID | Zone              | OS          |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| 10      | Pediatrics         | Windows     |
| 20      | Surgery            | Windows     |
| 30      | Medical Records    | Windows     |
| 40      | Guest              | Windows     |
| 50      | Administration     | Windows     |
| -       | SysAdmin           | Windows     |
| -       | DMZ – Web Server   | Ubuntu      |

**Note:**  
- The SysAdmin zone is directly connected to the OPNsense LAN interface for secure access.  
- The DMZ hosts a public-facing web service for booking, isolated on a dedicated interface.

> **Notes:**
> 1. SFTP only — read and transfer of own department records to local machine.
> 2. Filtered via Zenarmor NGFW policy.
> 3. Pull model — Medical Records does not initiate connections; other departments pull data from it.
> 4. SFTP only — read and transfer of clinical records and bookings to local machine + web access.
> 5. HTTPS only.

## Objectives

- Install and configure **OPNsense** as the perimeter firewall
- Integrate and enable **Zenarmor** as NGFW for traffic inspection and advanced policy enforcement
- Apply **custom firewall rules** between internal segments
- Perform **connectivity tests** and analyze **real-time firewall logs**
- Simulate attacks (e.g., brute-force on RDP) to validate policy effectiveness

---

## Technologies Used

- [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) (FreeBSD-based open-source firewall)
- [Zenarmor](https://www.zenarmor.com/) (NGFW plugin)
- VMware Workstation
- Windows (hospital environments)
- Kali Linux (attack simulation)
- Ubuntu Server (DMZ web service)
